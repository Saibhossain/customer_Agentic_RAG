# Agentic RAG for Customer Behavior Analysis (Prototype)

A **lightweight, production-style prototype** demonstrating how a **RAG Agent** can be used for **customer behavior analysis** — specifically, predicting the **probability of the next item purchase** and **explaining it using retrieved historical evidence**.

This project is inspired by **retail scenarios like Walmart**, but implemented using **modern AI concepts** such as:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic decision-making
- Probabilistic sequence modeling

> This is a **prototype / proof-of-concept**, not a full-scale recommender system.

---

##  Project Objective

Given a customer’s recent purchase history:
1. Predict **what item the customer is likely to buy next**
2. Compute **probabilities** of next-item choices
3. **Explain** the prediction by retrieving similar historical purchase sequences using a **RAG Agent**

---

##  Key Idea

Traditional recommendation systems *predict* but rarely *explain*.

This project introduces a **RAG Agent** that:
- Decides **when retrieval is needed**
- Retrieves similar historical purchase sequences
- Grounds predictions in **real transaction evidence**

Example output:
```json
{
  "last_item": "Milk",
  "next_item_probabilities": {
    "Eggs": 1.0
  },
  "retrieved_examples": [
    "Bread-> Milk-> Eggs",
    "Diapers-> Wipes-> Baby Lotion",
    "Soap-> Shampoo"
  ]
}
```
